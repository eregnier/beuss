simple message bus mainly for studying socket with golang. But yay!  it works is quite efficient and is dead simple to use.

But yay!  it works is quite efficient and is dead simple to use. What's more it is designed to have 0 dependencies and being very lightweight. So the target binary is about 3Mb to run the whole thing and requires few memory (~1Mb)

By it's nature (pure golang) it shoud be very portable to the main OS (linux, raspberry pi, windows, macos)
